Printable_Line_Following_Robot
==============================
This is a mostly printable line following robot I created for a class project. The drawings are done in SolidWorks.
While the original schematic for the robot's electronics has yet to be posted (I need to dig them up or recreate them),
this design can be used as platform for robots with similar applications/footprints.

This design is intedned to use two continuous servos with the horns of the servos mounted and glued into the traps in
the wheels. This is inconvient in terms of reuse, but very simple to get started and assemble. The "simple wheel" has 
a groove around the cirumference of the wheel. Just insert a rubber band around the wheel for some pretty awesome and
clever traction. 

The design I had originally created was for using reflective sensors. To mount the reflective sensors onto the robot, I
created an adjustable arm and "tray" that would hold a PCB or perfboard with the sensor array. It is possible to attach
something other than a sensor array to the arm. Just use the correct dimension for the clevis and fit a pin through the
orifice for the clevice. See the finished robot for clarification. 



////////////////////////////////
Things To-Do and To Look Out For
////////////////////////////////
1. The schematic for the line sensors and the MCU are still missing.
2. Add photos of the bot so you can see what the hell is going on.
